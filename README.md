# Rich Text Editor â€“ Document Content Validator

This application allows you to check whether your DOCX or RTF document contains tags ignored by the Rich Text Editor when it displays the document. 

Run the application and open your document. The **Skipped Content** table displays skipped tags that can affect document content and appearance.
